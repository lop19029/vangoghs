                    He began late and died young. Yet, over a span of 10 years, Vincent van Gogh (1853–1890) 
                    completed nearly 900 paintings and 1,100 sketches, lithographs, and other works.
                    The troubled Dutch artist became obsessed with his subjects and returned to them again and again, 
                    painting near duplicates of sunflowers or cypress trees. With manic brushstrokes and dramatic flourishes of his palette knife, 
                    Van Gogh carried Post-Impressionism into new realms.

                <h4><i>"The Potato Eaters" (April 1885)</i></h4>
                <p>Van Gogh spent a couple of years doing preliminary sketches, portrait studies, 
                    and lithographs before he completed the version of "The Potato Eaters" shown here. 
                    The subject matter illustrates van Gogh's affection for the simple, rugged lives of common people. 
                    He depicted the peasants with gnarled hands and cartoonishly ugly faces illuminated by the dim glow of a hanging lantern.</p>

                <h4><i>"The Night Café" (September 1888)</i></h4>
                <p>Sleeping during the day, van Gogh spent three nights in the café working on the painting. 
                    He chose the jarring effect of simultaneous contrast to express the "terrible passions of humanity."</p>

                <h4><i>"The Bedroom" (October 1888)</i></h4>
                <p>During his stay in Arles, van Gogh wrote in detail about the colors he found in his bedroom at Place Lamartine ("the yellow house"). 
                    In October 1888, he began a series of sketches and three oil paintings that showed nearly 
                    duplicate views of the room.</p>

                <h4><i>"Wheat Field with Cypresses at the Haute Galline Near Eygalieres" (July 1889)</i></h4>
                <p>With his characteristic bold impasto, the artist rendered the trees and surrounding 
                    landscape with dynamic swirls of color. The heavy layers of paint took on added texture 
                    from the asymmetrical weave of the toile ordinaire canvas that van Gogh ordered from Paris 
                    and used for most of his later works.</p>

                <h4><i>"The Red Vineyards at Arles" (November 1888)</i></h4>
                <p>"The Red Vineyards at Arles" captured the vibrant color and shimmering light that washed through 
                    southern France in early November. Fellow artist Gauguin may have inspired the vibrant colors. 
                    However, the heavy layers of paint and energetic brush strokes were distinctively van Gogh.</p>

                <h4><i>"Wheatfield With Crows" (July 1890)</i></h4>
                <p>"I made a point of trying to express sadness, extreme loneliness," he told his brother. 
                    Van Gogh may have been referencing several very similar paintings completed in Auvers, France, 
                    during this time. "Wheatfield with Crows" is especially menacing. The colors and images suggest 
                    potent symbols.</p>
